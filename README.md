# Post Management App
Overview
The Post Management App is a simple, full-featured application that allows users to create, like, and delete posts. Users can also add comments to posts and search for specific posts or authors. Authentication ensures that only logged-in users can interact with the application, and it provides session persistence for a better user experience.

Features
Authentication: Users can log in and have their session remembered.
Create Posts: Users can add posts with a title and content.
Like and Unlike: Users can like and unlike posts, with likes tracked in Firebase Firestore.
Delete Posts: Users can delete their own posts, with a confirmation prompt.
Comment on Posts: Users can add comments to posts.
Search Functionality: Users can search for posts by title, content, or the author’s username.
Session Persistence: User sessions are persisted using localStorage.
Technologies Used
React: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
Firebase:
Firestore: For storing posts, likes, and comments.
Firebase Authentication: For user authentication and session management.
CSS: For styling the application.
